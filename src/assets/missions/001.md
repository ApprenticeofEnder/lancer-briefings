## Operation Shattered Vision

## Goals

- **PRIMARY**: Track down G-SEC fireteam Lighthouse.
- **SECONDARY**: Investigate the administrative NHP onsite.

## Parameters

Estimated arrival at the Bafaru Facility is in T-minus 3 days, 4 hours.

- G-SEC Lighthouse was in good standing with the locals on Kibo. This should help in navigating the social landscape.
- SSC has been alerted to our arrival and will be on standby to provide aid if need be.
- Current weather patterns on Kibo indicate a severe thunderstorm in the nearby Kimawense range.
- Local atmosphere will require hardsuits on where possible.
  - *Barometric reports indicate atmospheric pressure of ~0.06 atm*.
- Omninet access is provided by the ACA intranet.

## Stakes

- Failure to recover G-SEC Lighthouse and associated MSMC assets will result in potential reputation damage to Bloodhound Squadron, the 413th, and MSMC as a whole.
  - This also means MSMC will have lost valuable team members.
  - Future contracts will not be nearly as fruitful.

## Reserves

- Additional resources, gear, and intel may be obtained planetside. 1 day is allocated for acclimation.
